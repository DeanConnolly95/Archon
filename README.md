# ArchonPrime
ArchonPrime - a collaborative PHP-based user registration/login system applicable to many a web application.

## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to ArchonPrime - led by DeanConnolly95@Github, this project is designed to encourage many a web project to use an open-source PHP-based login/register system with regular revisions and updates, without the struggle of having to write their own or configure difficult files - some of the few things that deter people from using pre-structured PHP scripts in their code.
