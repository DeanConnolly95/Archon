# ArchonPrime
ArchonPrime - a collaborative PHP-based user registration/login system applicable to many a web application.

## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to ArchonPrime - led by DeanConnolly95@Github, this project is designed to encourage many a web project to use an open-source PHP-based login/register system with regular revisions and updates, without the struggle of having to write their own or configure difficult files - some of the few things that deter people from using pre-structured PHP scripts in their code.

## Installation
We're going to be spending some time writing this project before people can actually use it - so there's no installation yet - that's where YOU come in...
While this project is in development, we're going to need input, design ideas and improvements - but what we want is for the people who will use this project to help us create it in a shared vision - not a shared vision as in "you see the same as us", but rather as in "Let's have an idea, let's create something that gels our visions together"!

## Licensing
We use the Apache 2.0 license - you should all know what that means, but just in case you don't, _[here's a breakdown of what you need to know about it](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0))_ :)
